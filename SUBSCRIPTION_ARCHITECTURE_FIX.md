# Subscription Screen Architecture Fix

## Problem
The subscription screen was in `/app/auth/subscription.tsx` which caused:
- AuthGuard redirecting authenticated users away from auth screens
- Navigation loops and immediate screen closing
- Complex workarounds that still didn't work

## Solution
Moved subscription screen to the root level: `/app/subscription.tsx`

## Changes Made

### 1. **Moved File**
```bash
mv app/auth/subscription.tsx app/subscription.tsx
```

### 2. **Updated Navigation**
Created simple navigation utility:
```typescript
// utils/subscription-navigation.ts
export const navigateToSubscription = () => {
  router.push('/subscription');
};
```

### 3. **Updated All References**
- HamburgerMenu.tsx
- SubscriptionBanner-v2.tsx
- TrialBanner.tsx
- SubscriptionBanner.tsx
- SubscriptionGuard.tsx
- reports/index.tsx
- items/index.tsx

### 4. **Cleaned Up AuthGuard**
Removed all workarounds:
- No more `isNavigatingToSubscription` flag
- No more special cases for subscription screen
- Simple, clean auth logic

### 5. **Updated Build Scripts**
- pre-build-checklist.sh
- smart-build-release.sh

## Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: No complex navigation logic
2. **Reliability**: Works like any other screen
3. **Maintainability**: Easy to understand
4. **Performance**: No extra checks or delays

## How It Works Now

```
User clicks "Subscription Plans"
    ↓
Navigate to /subscription (not in auth folder)
    ↓
AuthGuard doesn't interfere
    ↓
Screen loads normally
    ↓
Payment requires authentication (handled internally)
```

## Testing

All navigation paths work:
- ✅ From hamburger menu
- ✅ From subscription banners
- ✅ From trial banner
- ✅ From locked features
- ✅ From reports screen

## Build Your Release

```bash
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
```

The APK will be at: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk`
